  <h1>Playing Battleship on Ethereum</h1>
</div>

## Project objective

The project required the implementation of the Battleship game on the Ethereum blockchain, so that the properties of the blockchain, i.e. tamper-freeness, the possibility of auditing the fair rules of the game, encoded in smart contracts, instant and secure reward payments, and secure rewarding implementation, could be exploited. Furthermore, implementing the game on a permissionless blockchain implies that participating in the game cannot be prevented from anyone, since there is no censoring authority.
